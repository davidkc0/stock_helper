account_size: 42000.0
# Total account value in dollars - used for position sizing calculations
# Affects maximum risk per trade and collateral requirements

max_risk_per_trade_pct: 1.0
# Maximum percentage of account to risk on any single trade (1% = $420)
# For spreads/condors, this is the maximum loss if trade goes against you

max_collateral_pct: 40.0
# Maximum percentage of account to use as collateral for cash-secured puts
# 40% = $16,800 maximum collateral across all CSP positions

max_total_allocation_pct: 60.0
# Maximum percentage of account allocated to all options positions combined
# 60% = $25,200 maximum total allocation across all strategies

# Strategy Selection Parameters
# ============================
dte_min: 30
# Minimum Days To Expiration - only consider options expiring 30+ days out
# Longer DTE gives more time for trade to work out, reduces gamma risk

dte_max: 60
# Maximum Days To Expiration - only consider options expiring within 60 days
# Shorter DTE captures more theta decay, reduces time value risk

target_short_delta: 0.22
# Target delta for short options (0.22 = 22 delta)
# Lower delta = higher probability of profit, lower credit received
# 0.22 is a balanced approach (roughly 22% probability of being in-the-money)

delta_band: 0.08
# Acceptable range around target delta (±0.08)
# Allows flexibility in strike selection while maintaining risk profile
# 0.22 ± 0.08 = acceptable range of 0.14 to 0.30 delta

spread_width_low: 2.0
# Width of spreads for stocks priced under $100 (in dollars)
# $2 width = $200 max risk per spread

spread_width_high: 5.0
# Width of spreads for stocks priced $100+ (in dollars)
# $5 width = $500 max risk per spread

# Liquidity and Quality Filters
# ============================
max_bid_ask_pct: 1.0
# Maximum bid/ask spread as percentage of mid price (100% = very wide spreads allowed)
# Lower values = tighter spreads = better liquidity = easier to enter/exit
# 1.0 allows wide spreads (relaxed for more opportunities)

min_open_interest: 1
# Minimum open interest required for option contracts
# Higher OI = more liquid = easier to trade
# 1 = any OI > 0 (very relaxed)

min_volume: 10
# Minimum daily volume required for option contracts
# Higher volume = more active trading = better pricing
# 10 = minimum volume requirement (relaxed)

min_option_price: 0.01
# Minimum option price in dollars (avoids penny options)
# Very low options may have poor liquidity or pricing issues
# 0.01 = $0.01 minimum (very relaxed)

# Volatility Analysis Settings
# ===========================
iv_rank_lookback_days: 252
# Number of trading days to look back for IV rank calculation
# 252 = one full trading year (standard for IV rank)

high_iv_threshold: 0.6
# IV rank threshold above which to favor premium-selling strategies
# 0.6 = 60th percentile - when IV is high, sell premium

low_iv_threshold: 0.3
# IV rank threshold below which to favor premium-buying strategies
# 0.3 = 30th percentile - when IV is low, buy premium

# Market Regime Detection
# ======================
trend_sma_periods: [20, 50, 100]
# Simple Moving Average periods for trend analysis
# 20-day = short-term trend, 50-day = medium-term, 100-day = long-term
# Used to determine if market is trending or ranging

volatility_regime_threshold: 1.5
# ATR multiplier to determine volatility regime
# Current ATR vs historical average to classify market volatility
# 1.5 = 50% above average = high volatility regime

# Risk Management Parameters
# =========================
risk_free_rate: 0.045
# Current risk-free interest rate (4.5% = typical for current environment)
# Used in Black-Scholes calculations for option pricing

take_profit_pct: 0.50
# Take profit at 50% of maximum profit
# Close winning trades when 50% of potential profit is achieved
# Balances profit-taking with letting winners run

stop_loss_mult: 2.0
# Stop loss at 2.0x the credit received
# If loss reaches 2x the premium collected, close the trade
# Prevents small losses from becoming large losses

kelly_fraction: 0.25
# Kelly criterion multiplier for position sizing
# 0.25 = use 25% of Kelly criterion recommendation
# Conservative approach to position sizing

# Output and Performance Settings
# ==============================
max_ideas: 5
# Maximum number of trading ideas to display
# Top 5 scoring opportunities will be shown

skip_earnings_within_days: 7
# Avoid trades on stocks with earnings within 7 days
# Earnings can cause large price moves and IV changes
# Reduces earnings-related risk

# Data Provider Configuration
# ==========================
provider: "yfinance"
# Data source for market data (yfinance = free, delayed data)
# Alternatives: polygon, tradier (require API keys)

polygon_api_key: null
# API key for Polygon.io data (if using polygon provider)
# null = not using polygon

tradier_access_token: null
# Access token for Tradier data (if using tradier provider)
# null = not using tradier

# Performance Settings
# ===================
use_concurrent: false
# Use parallel processing to analyze multiple symbols simultaneously
# Set to false to avoid rate limiting with yfinance API
# Sequential processing is slower but safer

max_workers: 1
# Maximum number of parallel workers for concurrent processing
# Set to 1 when use_concurrent is false
# 1 worker = analyze 1 symbol at a time (safer for rate limits)
